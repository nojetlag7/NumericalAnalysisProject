## 📈 Project Methodology

   - Predict the remaining 100 actual prices (days 101-200)
4. **Evaluation**: Compare predictions against actual prices using multiple metrics

### Interpolation Methods Explained:

#### 1. **Lagrange Interpolation**
- **Method**: Constructs a polynomial that passes through all given points
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Global polynomial approach
  - Can exhibit oscillations (Runge's phenomenon)
  - Computationally expensive for large datasets
- **Use Case**: Works well for smooth, well-behaved data

#### 2. **Newton's Divided Difference**
- **Method**: Builds polynomial using divided differences table
- **Characteristics**:
  - Efficient for adding new data points
  - More stable than Lagrange for computation
  - Same polynomial as Lagrange but different computation
- **Use Case**: Preferred when data points are frequently added

#### 3. **Newton's Forward Difference**
- **Method**: Uses forward differences for extrapolation
- **Characteristics**:
  - Designed for equally spaced data points
  - Better suited for extrapolation beyond known range
  - Uses factorial terms in computation
- **Use Case**: Ideal for time series forecasting

## 📊 Analysis Criteria Explained

### 1. **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**
**Formula**: `MSE = (1/n) * Σ(actual - predicted)²`

**What it measures**: Average of squared differences between actual and predicted values

**Interpretation**:
- **Lower values = Better performance**
- **Range**: 0 to ∞ (0 is perfect)
- **Units**: Same as the square of the target variable (e.g., dollars²)
- **Sensitivity**: Heavily penalizes large errors due to squaring

**Example Values**:
- MSE = 0: Perfect predictions
- MSE = 100: Average squared error of 100 (average error ≈ 10 units)
- MSE = 10000: Average squared error of 10000 (average error ≈ 100 units)

### 2. **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
**Formula**: `MAE = (1/n) * Σ|actual - predicted|`

**What it measures**: Average absolute difference between actual and predicted values

**Interpretation**:
- **Lower values = Better performance**
- **Range**: 0 to ∞ (0 is perfect)
- **Units**: Same as the target variable (e.g., dollars)
- **Sensitivity**: Treats all errors equally (no squaring)

**Example Values**:
- MAE = 0: Perfect predictions
- MAE = 5: Average error of $5 per prediction
- MAE = 50: Average error of $50 per prediction

### 3. **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**
**Formula**: `R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)`
- Where SS_res = Σ(actual - predicted)²
- Where SS_tot = Σ(actual - mean_actual)²

**What it measures**: Proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model

**Interpretation**:
- **Higher values = Better performance**
- **Range**: -∞ to 1
- **Units**: Dimensionless (proportion/percentage)

**Value Interpretation**:
- **R² = 1.0**: Perfect model (explains 100% of variance)
- **R² = 0.8**: Good model (explains 80% of variance)
- **R² = 0.5**: Moderate model (explains 50% of variance)
- **R² = 0.0**: Model performs as well as predicting the mean
- **R² < 0**: Model performs worse than predicting the mean

### Metric Comparison Guidelines:

| Performance Level | R² Score | MSE | MAE |
|------------------|----------|-----|-----|
| Excellent | > 0.9 | Very Low | Very Low |
| Good | 0.7 - 0.9 | Low | Low |
| Moderate | 0.4 - 0.7 | Moderate | Moderate |
| Poor | 0.1 - 0.4 | High | High |
| Very Poor | < 0.1 | Very High | Very High |
